        His dedication to understanding the &ldquo;why&rdquo; behind everything we wanted to build pushed our team to deepen our understanding of the user, think about how to prototype things more creatively, and improve the quality of our research and prototypes. &hellip; I found him very capable of doing all types of user research&mdash;exploratory, in-depth, remote, in situ, surveys, guerrilla&mdash;and <mark>trusted him to take on a full cycle of prototyping and testing</mark> when we had several concepts happening at once.
