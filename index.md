# About

Hi, I'm Arthur Klepchukov, a UX Designer and Engineer in San Francisco.

## Goal

I want to find a __product design__ role at a company with a design team I collaborate with on a regular basis. I care about enabling creativity in others, whether via products or services used to produce creative work, things that enable learning or inspiration, or tools to be productive in the other areas of life in a way that leaves room for making things.

## What makes me an empathetic designer
* moved twenty times and lived in various parts of the United States
* born in Ukraine and have [visited in tumultuous times](https://arsenalofwords.com/2014/02/23/maidan-morning/){:target="_blank"}
* write novels, short stories, [poems](https://arsenalofwords.com/projects/blinks-of-awe/){:target="_blank"}, and creative nonfiction
* unafraid of [open mic nights](https://twitter.com/KarlyCaserza/status/832810955759181824){:target="_blank"}
* host weekly [writing meetups](https://www.meetup.com/shutupandwriteSFO/events/238801698/){:target="_blank"}
* make short films [like Nomad](https://vimeo.com/84480973){:target="_blank"}
* drawn and sold comics [in stores](http://fantasticcomics.net/){:target="_blank"}
* fluent in Russian
* 3-time startup founder
* worked across industries: government, music videos, academia, travel, creative writing

## If I could wave a magic wand...
My dream design job would be to work on an operating system that successfully challenges the desktop metaphor, in a way that mobile ones have not.
