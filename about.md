# About me

Hi, I'm Arthur Klepchukov, a UX designer who loves words, trains, and the promise of an empty page. <mark>Discovering the right things to create is more fun than building unvalidated visions.</mark> I'm often the first to ask why, seek metrics, or start sketching flows. I crave understanding user goals, business needs, and how a product or service can fit into the broader world.
