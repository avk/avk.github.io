Hi, I'm Arthur Klepchukov, an empathetic UX designer in San Francisco who loves words, trains, and the promise of an empty page. I'm a 3x startup founder, UC Berkeley graduate, and at the intersection of design, product, and engineering. I'm passionate about discovering the right things to create, not just building unvalidated visions. I'm often the first to ask why, seek metrics, or start sketching flows. I crave understanding both users and how a product or service can fit into the broader world.

## Goal

{% include goal.md %}

## Skills

I'm proficient in user flows, wireframing, prototyping, and product metrics.

# How we'll work together

### Christine Lee, UX Designer at TheRightMargin

"His dedication to understanding the "why" behind everything we wanted to build pushed our team to deepen our understanding of the user, think about how to prototype things more creatively, and improve the quality of our research and prototypes. ... I found him very capable of doing all types of user research - exploratory, in-depth, remote, in situ, surveys, guerrilla - and trusted him to take on a full cycle of prototyping and testing when we had several concepts happening at once."

> "... pushed our team to deepen our understanding of the user..."

### Will Sullivan, Head of Marketing at TheRightMargin

"Art has the ability to think across UX, design, engineering, analytics, and marketing. His approaches are always even-keeled and thoughtful and he is comfortable leading projects or supporting other team members who may be running specific experiments. ...I found his deep empathy for the user to be his greatest attribute."

As an engineer he is detailed oriented and always looking to up his game with best practices and improvements in tooling and workflow. He also has a passion for UX and truly cares about the user."
