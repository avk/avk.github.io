# About

Hi, I'm Arthur Klepchukov, a UX designer who loves words, trains, and the promise of an empty page. I'm a 3-time startup founder, <abbr title="University of California, Berkeley">UC Berkeley</abbr> graduate, and at the intersection of design, product, and engineering. I enjoy discovering the right things to create, not just building unvalidated visions. I'm often the first to ask why, seek metrics, or start sketching flows. I crave understanding both users and how a product or service can fit into the broader world.

## Goal

{% include goal.md %}

## Key Skills

I'm best at user flows, wireframing, prototyping, and product metrics.

My perpetual interests include: effective writing, typography, information architecture, HTML & CSS, and the power of the web.

      His dedication to understanding the &ldquo;why&rdquo; behind everything we wanted to build pushed our team to deepen our understanding of the user, think about how to prototype things more creatively, and improve the quality of our research and prototypes. &hellip; I found him very capable of doing all types of user research&mdash;exploratory, in-depth, remote, in situ, surveys, guerrilla&mdash;and trusted him to take on a full cycle of prototyping and testing when we had several concepts happening at once.

      Art has the ability to think across UX, design, engineering, analytics, and marketing. His approaches are always even-keeled and thoughtful and he is comfortable leading projects or supporting other team members who may be running specific experiments. &hellip; I found his deep empathy for the user to be his greatest attribute.

As an engineer he is detailed oriented and always looking to up his game with best practices and improvements in tooling and workflow. He also has a passion for UX and truly cares about the user.
