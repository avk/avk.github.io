# About Art

Hi, I'm Arthur Klepchukov, a UX designer who loves words, trains, and the promise of an empty page. I'm a 3-time startup founder, <abbr title="University of California, Berkeley">UC Berkeley</abbr> graduate, and at the intersection of design, product, and engineering. I enjoy discovering the right things to create, not just building unvalidated visions. I'm often the first to ask why, seek metrics, or start sketching flows. I crave understanding both users and how a product or service can fit into the broader world.

## Goals & Directions

{% include goal.md %}

## Key Skills

I'm best at user flows, wireframing, prototyping, and product metrics.

My perpetual interests include: effective writing, typography, information architecture, HTML & CSS, and the power of the web.
